Name: Khalid Oyebode  
Student Number: 101367092  
Course/Section: IMD1005B — Web Development  
Semester: Winter 2026  

Site Purpose
This website is for an independent musician (K3soulja).  
The goal is to give fans one place to:
- Stream the latest release
- View upcoming shows
- Watch music videos
- Browse merch
- Contact for bookings or collaborations

This matches the client goals from Assignment 1 

 Pages
- Home (index.html): Landing page with hero/intro, featured music section, and tour section  
- Videos (videos.html): Embedded YouTube videos displayed using CSS Grid  
- Merch (merch.html): Merch items displayed using Flexbox  
- Credits (credits.html): Credits and sources  
- Contact (contact.html): Form page with labeled inputs (Name, Email, Topic, Message)

 Design Changes From Assignment 1 (and why)
Compared to my Assignment 1 design, I made these changes while coding:
- Simplified the layout into fewer sections to keep the site fast and easy to navigate.
- Used a dark theme with a bright color for buttons/footers to keep the bold and energetic feel.
- Put the most important actions in a fixed navigation bar.

 AI Usage (Required)
Tools used: ChatGPT  
What I used it for:
- Helped structure an accessible form with correct `<label for="">` + matching input `id`
- Helped implement a simple CSS Grid layout for the video gallery
- Suggested `box-sizing: border-box` as a best practice for the box model

What I learned:
- How labels connect to inputs for accessibility
- When to use Grid (gallery/layout) vs Flexbox (row-based items)
- How box sizing affects width/padding calculations

AI-assisted sections are marked in code comments where used.
